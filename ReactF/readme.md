# Why should you learn react?

  - to get raise in your current package and to avoid struggles after the project work
  -Complex DOM manipulate
  -Spaghetti code(complex code, tangled and difficult to maintain)
  - state management in pure JS is very difficult, but react makes it simplified
  - reuseability 
  - Pure html, css, js may create redundant code and will creat web performance issues
  - Scalibility issue via JS, but can easily handle via React
  - component based architechture
  - Uses Virtual DOM rather than Real Dom 
  - Strong community support


# What is React?

 - It's a front-end JS Library (angular is framework) developed by facebook in 2011
 - It's an open-source JS library 

# What is componet in react?
  - An independent and resuable of code
  - They are similar to js func but work independently and return the JSX elements

# What is JSX elements?
  - JSX for js XML and the file extension for writing a component is .jsx 
  - JSX = js embeds HTML = Js+ html 

# Why should we use JSX?
 - JSX is faster than regular JS due to optimisation during the translation phase to JS obj
 - Combine the markup and JS logic inside a single component

 # where can you write JSX?
 - Expressions, func, variables, loops, event handlers

 # What is ReactDOM and what does it do?
 - ReactDOM is a react lib for rendering the components into the real DOM 

 # What is build tools?
 - provides you the complete ecosystem to build production ready code for react apps.
 - majorly we have 3 builds:
 1.webpack:

  Prereq for: NodeJS, npm(node package manager) 

  using to build react app using CRA(create react apps) - npx create-react-app 

 2. Vite (uses roll up bts)

 3. parcel
